        </div>
        <p class="para">The <a>Sayfo</a>, or <a>Assyrian</a> genocide, was the mass slaughter and deportation of <a>Assyrian</a> and <a>Syriac Christians</a> in southeastern <a>Anatolia</a> and <a>Persia's Azerbaijan province</a> committed by <a>Ottoman</a> forces and <a>Kurdish</a> tribes during World War I. The <a>Assyrians</a> lived in mountainous and remote areas and were divided into several mutually antagonistic churches. Mass killing of <a>Assyrian</a> civilians began in January 1915, by the <a>Ottoman</a> military and pro-Ottoman Kurds. Attacks on, massacres of and deportations of <a>Christian</a> populations continued until 1919, usually facing only <a>sporadic</a> armed resistance. <a>Assyrians</a> living in present-day <a>Iraq</a> and <a>Syria</a> were not targeted. The <a>Sayfo</a>occured concurrently with and was closely related to the <a>Armenian genocide</a>. Motives included a perceived lack of loyalty among some <a>Assyrian</a> communities to the <a>Ottoman</a> Empire and a desire to appropriate their land. In 1919 the <a>Assyrians</a> said that roughly 250,000 were killed in the genocide, about half the pre-war population. (<a>Full article...</a>)</p>
